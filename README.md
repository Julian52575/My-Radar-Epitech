# My-radar Epitech Nancy 2023
This is a simulation game realized in CSFML.  
To load a simulation, run 
  ```./my_radar [scripts/script100.rdr] ```
with one of the premade script.   
Or build your own with
  ```./my_radar -g [nb_of_planes] [nb_of_towers] [file_to_save_the_script] ``` !   
But
  ```make```
sure you have built the binary before !

There is a bunch of user interaction !    
  do ```./my_radar -h```to see them all !
