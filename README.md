# My-radar Epitech Nancy 2023
This is a simulation game realized in CSFML.    
Pokemons flies arround and disapears if they enter another pokemon's hitbox UNLESS they are inside a control tower's radius.
    
    
To load a simulation, run 
  ```./my_radar [scripts/script100.rdr] ```
with one of the premade script.   
Or build your own with
  ```./my_radar -g [nb_of_planes] [nb_of_towers] [file_to_save_the_script] ``` !   
But ```make```
sure you have built the binary before !

There is a bunch of user interaction !    
    do ```./my_radar -h```to see them all !
