# My-radar
Epitech Nancy project from 2023\n
This is a simulation game realized in CSFML.\n
To load a simulation, run\n
  ```./my_radar [scripts/script100.rdr] ```
with one of the premade script.\n
Or build your own with
  ```./my_radar -g [nb_of_planes] [nb_of_towers] [file_to_save_the_script] !```
\nBut
  ```make```
sure you have built the binary before !
