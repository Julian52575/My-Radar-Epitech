# My-radar
Epitech Nancy project from 2023 
This is a simulation game realized in CSFML.
To load a simulation, run <sup> ./my_radar [scripts/script100.rdr] </sup> with one of the premade script.
Or build your own with <sup> ./my_radar -g [nb_of_planes] [nb_of_towers] [file_to_save_the_script] </sup> !
But <sup> make </sup> sure you have built the binary before !
